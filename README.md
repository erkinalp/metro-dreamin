## Project Structure

### Core application code: `app/`
`app/` contains all the code for the Next.js/React front end and server side rendering. Run `yarn dev` to start up a local Next server that connects to the staging Firebase account. It can run connected to a local Firebase emulator by running `start_emulators.sh` and then starting Next with `yarn local`.

### Firebase functions code: `functions/`
`functions/` contains a simple express-based REST server that handles requests to modify tables mostly associated with version 2.0. Use `yarn serve` to run locally and `yarn deploy` to deploy only Firebase functions. It also includes database callback functions associated with version 3.0 to do things like generate thumbnails, send notifications, etc.

### City map scripts: `city_scripts/`
`city_scripts/` contains all of the scripts used to generate the default map options.

### Maintenance: `maintenance_scripts/`
`maintenance_scripts/` contains scripts used for certain database operations. The `migration/` subfolder contains the scripts used to migrate data for version 3.0.
